# Digital Intelligent Platform for ESG Performance and GHG Monitoring

A centralized digital platform to measure, manage, analyze, and report ESG performance with a strong focus on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions tracking across Scope 1, Scope 2, and material Scope 3 categories.

## 1. Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle with fragmented ESG and emissions data spread across departments, systems, and suppliers. Manual collection creates errors, delays, and weak auditability. As a result, leadership lacks a reliable source of truth for carbon footprint reporting, scenario planning, and transition strategy.

This platform is designed to solve that by creating a unified, scalable, and assurance-ready ESG data system.

## 2. Project Goals

### Core Objectives
- Establish a standardized enterprise-wide GHG emissions measurement system.
- Centralize operational and value-chain activity data for accurate emissions calculations.
- Build a Scope 3 engagement model to prioritize high-impact supplier categories.
- Support climate accountability with governance, approvals, and escalation workflows.
- Enable assurance-ready reporting with audit trails, validation, and exportable sustainability reports.

## 3. Scope
